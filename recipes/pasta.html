        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pasta is a versatile Italian staple that can be paired with various sauces and toppings. Here, we'll prepare a simple spaghetti dish with a classic tomato sauce.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Spaghetti or your favorite pasta shape</li>
            <li>Tomato sauce (store-bought or homemade)</li>
            <li>Garlic and onion</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt, pepper, and Italian herbs (such as basil and oregano)</li>
            <li>Grated parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the pasta according to the instructions on the package until it's al dente (firm to the bite). Drain the pasta and set it aside, reserving a little pasta water.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add minced garlic and diced onion and saut√© until they become fragrant and translucent.</li>
            <li>Pour in the tomato sauce and season with salt, pepper, and Italian herbs. Let the sauce simmer for a few minutes to develop the flavors.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked pasta to the skillet and toss it with the sauce until the pasta is evenly coated. If the sauce seems too thick, add a splash of the reserved pasta water to loosen it up.</li>
            <li>Serve the pasta hot, garnished with grated parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
        </ol>
