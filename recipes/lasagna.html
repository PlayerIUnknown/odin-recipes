        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of pasta sheets, rich meat sauce (ragù), creamy béchamel sauce, and cheese. It's a delicious and comforting meal that's perfect for gatherings or family dinners.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Lasagna noodles (oven-ready or pre-boiled)</li>
            <li>Ground beef or Italian sausage (you can also use a combination of both)</li>
            <li>Onion, garlic, and other vegetables (optional)</li>
            <li>Tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>Béchamel sauce (white sauce made with butter, flour, and milk)</li>
            <li>Ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>Shredded mozzarella and parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Salt, pepper, and Italian herbs (such as basil, oregano, and thyme)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to the temperature specified on the lasagna noodle package.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat until browned. If you're using vegetables, add them to the skillet and sauté until softened.</li>
            <li>Pour in the tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes and season with salt, pepper, and Italian herbs. Let the sauce simmer for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a separate saucepan, prepare the béchamel sauce by melting butter, stirring in flour, and slowly whisking in milk until it thickens.</li>
            <li>In a baking dish, spread a layer of meat sauce at the bottom. Add a layer of lasagna noodles on top, followed by a layer of ricotta cheese and béchamel sauce. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella and parmesan cheese over the sauce.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layers until you run out of ingredients, finishing with a layer of meat sauce and shredded cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna rest for a few minutes before serving to allow it to set.</li>
        </ol>
